Please note this problem stores the first character position of the word within the line number.. 
It does not store the occurence position of the entire string word.. 

For instance,

"test frank giordano" 

test located at line 1, position 0
frank located at line 1, position 5
etc

whereas entire word position would be:
test located at position 0 and frank located at position 1 and giordano located at position 3
